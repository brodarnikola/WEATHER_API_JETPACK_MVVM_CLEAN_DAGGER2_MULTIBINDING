# WEATHER_API_JETPACK_MVVM_CLEAN_DAGGER2_WITH_HILT_RXJAVA2

This is a project to practice, to gain more skills in jetpack libraries and other very good libraries from android.. 
like MVVM with clean arhitecture, dagger2 with hilt.. rxjava2, room,  fusedLocatonProviderApi, youtubePlayerApi, Services example with playing mp3 file in background,
viewmodel, livedata, viewbinding, navigation ( navHostFragment ) , fingerPrintApi, sealedClasses ( with Ui state, possibilities ), constraintlayout 

Added all possible Ui State ( Success, Error and Loading ) to Weather Fragment ( screen ) and to Forecast Fragment ( screen )
All of this possible state now comunicate with Rxjava2
Only Youtube fragment is left as it is ( without all possible Ui state ) . It has old implementation way with Rxjava2, viewmodel, livedata and view ( YoutubeFragment)
